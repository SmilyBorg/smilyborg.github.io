# Drones, UAVs, Quadcopters, etc 

Growing up, UAVs were science fiction. These days, a cheep quadcopter can be had for R250 or less. These devices have a range of uses from first person racing to photography, to environmental monitoring, to crowd control.

While the idea of racing drones seems fun to me, my interests lie more in the realm of photography, robotics experiments(swarm robotics), and just fpv flying. This is the closest we can currently get to being able to fly like Superman.
